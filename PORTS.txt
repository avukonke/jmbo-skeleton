A site that serves on basic, smart and web has this convention.

We use up to 100 ports for each site. Ports are offset from a port base. A typical port base is N=8100.

The Django processes use gunicorn and up to 9 ports per layer.

Web = N+11, N+12, ..., [N+19]
Basic = N+21, N+22, ..., [N+29]
Smart = N+31, N+32, ..., [N+39]

Haproxy asks a twisted process to do user-agent to layer mappings. It then
passes the request to a relevant Django backend.

haproxy device proxy = N
haproxy device proxy backends = N+1, N+2, N+3, N+4
haproxy device upstream = N+9
