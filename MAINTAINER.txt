A new release of skeleton typically requires:

1.  New minimum version of jmbo-foundry in setup.py
2.  Up depends_on in skeleton/migrations/0001_initial.py to latest foundry 
    migration.
3.  Run ./bin/buildout -Nv -c dev_basic_site.cfg and update versions.cfg with
    info printed to stdout. Ensure buildout, setuptools and distribute are not 
    in versions.cfg. Add lowercase entries for Django and South.
